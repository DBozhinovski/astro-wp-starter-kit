# Astro Starter Kit: WordPress

## Motivation

Astro is an amazing center-stack / BFF solution, which can be a great "glue" between what we nowadays consider a web application and a classical website. WordPress is the most commonly used CMS. Astro and WordPress make for a great combo in many scenarios. This project aims to provide a good starting point for any such scenarios.

### Use cases

- A devkit for using [WordPress as an API](https://darko.io/posts/astrojs-and-wordpress-as-an-api). Build on this stack locally, deploy connecting to a different WP instance in production.
- A WordPress blog, built as a static site.
- 

## Getting started

Assuming you have node, docker and docker-compose installed, run:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/DBozhinovski/wp-as-an-api your-site-name
```

This will create an empty Astro x WordPress scaffold, under the `your-site-name` directory. Navigate inside the directory and run:

```bash
npm run start-wp
```

Using `docker-compose` and via `./stack.yml` This creates a local WordPress instance from which you can build your website. 

For advanced use cases, see [advanced](#advanced).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
